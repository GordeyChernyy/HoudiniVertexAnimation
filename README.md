LWRP unity 2018.3.8f1

followed by this tutorial : https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/unity-shaders-for-vertex-animation-export-tools/

### Issue

Example package from https://github.com/sideeffects/GameDevelopmentToolset/blob/Development/unity/vertex_animation_examples.unitypackage 

When project converted to LWRP using these shaders https://github.com/sideeffects/GameDevelopmentToolset/tree/Development/unity/shaders/LWRP smoke and sparks work but cloth and rbd does not.
